The RMS Titanic was a British commercial passenger liner that sank after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912. More than 1,500 people lost their lives from an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew members while on their way to New York City from Southampton. 

This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck resulted in such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

The purpose of this tutorial will be to approach the Titanic dataset from the perspective of a passenger line insurance company. What are the risk factors to consider when selling passenger insurance? What can we learn from the automatic predictive models generated by Driverless AI and the Titanic Dataset?
